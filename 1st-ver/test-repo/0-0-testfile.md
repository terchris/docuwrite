## Internal Communication

Communication between internal systems must use Azure API Management (APIM) to ensure a single point of entry, easier monitoring, and improved security.

```mermaid
graph LR
 apim(APIM)
 db[("`db`")]
 devfunction1(devfunction1)
 devfunction2(devfunction2)
 devfunction3(devfunction3)
 resource(Resource)

 classDef controller fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
 class apim controller;

devfunction1 <--> apim
apim --> resource
resource <-..-> db
devfunction2 <--> apim <--> devfunction3
```

## External Communication

Communication from internal systems to external systems must use APIM to manage changes in external APIs efficiently.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "security-zone"
       firewall(Firewall)
       internetgw(InternetGW)
   end

   subgraph "landing-zone"
       apim1(APIM)
       prodfunction1(prodfunction1)
       prodfunction2(prodfunction2)
   end

   apim1 --> firewall
   firewall --> internetgw
   internetgw --> internet(Internet)
   internet --> internetresource1(brreg.no)
   internet --> internetresource2(external api)
   prodfunction1 --> apim1
   prodfunction2 --> apim1

   class apim1 controller;
   class landing-zone zone;
   classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000;
   classDef controller fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
   classDef zone fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;
   classDef groupCluster fill:#e8f0fe,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#000;
```

## Requests from External Systems

Requests from external systems go through the firewall and then to APIM in the landing zone.

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph "security-zone"
       firewall(Firewall)
   end

   subgraph "landing-zone"
       apim1(APIM)
       prodfunction1(prodfunction1)
       prodfunction2(prodfunction2)
   end

   firewall --> apim1
   internet(Internet) --> firewall
   internetresource1(external api1) --> internet
   internetresource2(external api2) --> internet

   apim1 --> prodfunction1
   apim1 --> prodfunction2

   class apim1 controller;
   class landing-zone zone;
   classDef plain fill:#ddd,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#000;
   classDef controller fill:#326ce5,stroke:#fff,stroke-width:4px,color:#fff;
   classDef zone fill:#fff,stroke:#bbb,stroke-width:2px,color:#326ce5;
