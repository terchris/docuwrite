## Azure Functions

Azure Functions is a serverless compute service that enables you to run event-triggered code without having to explicitly provision or manage infrastructure. Using Azure Functions, you can run a script or piece of code in response to a variety of events. Azure Functions can be used to process data, integrate systems, trigger alerts, and more.

### CAF naming conventions

Azure Functions should follow the [CAF naming conventions](7-0naming-caf.md).

### Programming languages

TODO: we need to decide on which programming languages to support in Azure Functions.

### Storage for Azure Functions

TODO: if we decide that each function needs its own storage account, we need to follow CAF naming conventions for storage accounts. We also need to figure out pricing related to storage accounts.
